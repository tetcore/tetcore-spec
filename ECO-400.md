# ECO-400  
## Network Token Specification  
**Status:** Draft v1.0  
**Category:** Economic Layer  

---

# 1. Purpose

This specification defines the native network token of Tetcore.

The network token is used for:

- Inference fee payment
- Gas payment
- Staking in Model Vaults
- Governance voting
- Validator rewards

The token is the primary economic unit of the protocol.

---

# 2. Token Identity

Token Name: Tetcore Network Token  
Symbol: TNT (placeholder, governance may define final symbol)  
Standard: Native protocol asset (not a contract token)

The token exists at the protocol level, not as a TCL contract.

---

# 3. Genesis Supply

---

## 3.1 Fixed Initial Supply

At genesis:

TOTAL_SUPPLY = 100,000,000,000 tokens (100 billion)

Supply must be created exactly once at genesis block.

No further minting permitted unless authorized via governance under explicit inflation rule.

---

## 3.2 Genesis Allocation

Genesis distribution must be defined in:

GenesisState configuration.

Genesis balances must sum exactly to TOTAL_SUPPLY.

Invariant:

Σ account_balances_genesis = TOTAL_SUPPLY

---

# 4. Decimal Format

---

## 4.1 Precision

Token uses fixed decimal precision:

DECIMALS = 18

Internal representation:

1 TNT = 10^18 base units

All balances stored as:

u128 base units

---

## 4.2 Representation

Displayed amount:

display_value = stored_value / 10^18

No floating point allowed in consensus logic.

---

# 5. Supply Invariants

At all times:

Σ balances + Σ escrow + Σ vault_staked + Σ locked_collateral = TOTAL_SUPPLY - burned_tokens

If burn mechanism enabled:

TOTAL_SUPPLY decreases deterministically.

---

# 6. Transfer Rules

---

## 6.1 Transfer Transaction

TransferPayload = {
  to: Address,
  amount: u128
}

Validation rules:

- amount > 0
- sender_balance ≥ amount
- to ≠ null address

---

## 6.2 State Mutation

On successful transfer:

balance[sender] -= amount  
balance[to] += amount  

Gas fee deducted separately.

---

## 6.3 Atomicity

Transfer must:

- Execute atomically
- Revert on insufficient balance
- Revert on overflow

---

# 7. Escrow Locking

Escrow for inference (IFP-102):

Escrowed funds are:

Temporarily removed from sender balance  
Held in Escrow ledger  

Escrow must:

Remain counted in total supply invariant.

---

# 8. Vault Staking Interaction

Staked tokens:

Removed from liquid balance  
Added to vault total_staked  

Remain part of total supply.

---

# 9. Gas Payment

Gas fee is deducted:

Before contract execution.

Gas fees may:

- Be routed to validators
- Be burned (governance option)

Gas deduction must be deterministic.

---

# 10. Burn Mechanism (Optional)

If burn enabled:

burn_amount removed from total supply.

State must track:

total_burned

New supply:

current_supply = TOTAL_SUPPLY - total_burned

Burn must:

Be explicitly defined in governance proposal.

---

# 11. Minting Rules

Default rule:

No minting after genesis.

If governance enables inflation:

Minting must:

- Be defined by explicit proposal
- Include cap and rate
- Be deterministic
- Preserve accounting invariants

---

# 12. Account Model

Accounts defined by:

Address → balance: u128

Balances must:

- Never be negative
- Never overflow u128
- Be updated atomically

---

# 13. Replay Protection

Transfers require:

Valid nonce (per TET-003)

Prevents replay across blocks.

---

# 14. Determinism Requirements

Token logic must:

- Use integer arithmetic only
- Use checked overflow behavior
- Apply canonical ordering for multi-recipient distributions
- Produce identical state roots across nodes

---

# 15. Security Constraints

Token system must prevent:

- Double spending
- Overflow minting
- Negative balances
- Escrow bypass
- Reentrancy-based duplication

---

# 16. Formal Token State

Let:

Balance[A] = u128

Transfer:

If Balance[A] ≥ x:

Balance[A] = Balance[A] - x  
Balance[B] = Balance[B] + x  

Else:

Revert.

---

# 17. Economic Role

Network token is:

- Medium of exchange for inference
- Governance power unit
- Staking asset
- Validator incentive asset

It is not a stablecoin.

---

# 18. Token Supply Transparency

Protocol must allow:

QueryTotalSupply()  
QueryBurnedSupply()  
QueryEscrowedSupply()  
QueryVaultStakedSupply()  

Transparency is required for economic trust.

---

# 19. Invariants Summary

- Initial supply = 100B tokens
- Integer-only arithmetic
- 18 decimal precision
- No implicit minting
- Deterministic accounting
- Conservation of value

---

# 20. Conclusion

ECO-400 defines the Tetcore Network Token as:

- Fixed 100B genesis supply
- 18-decimal precision
- Deterministic transfer rules
- Escrow-compatible
- Staking-compatible
- Governance-compatible

It is the foundational economic primitive of Tetcore’s intelligence infrastructure.
