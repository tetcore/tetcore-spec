# SDK-500  
## Tetcore SDK Blueprint Framework  
**Status:** Draft v1.0  
**Category:** Developer Infrastructure  

---

# 1. Purpose

This specification defines the Tetcore SDK Blueprint Framework.

The SDK enables developers to:

- Compose custom Tetcore runtimes
- Define module stacks
- Generate deterministic genesis configurations
- Bootstrap new networks
- Create testnets and sovereign deployments

Tetcore is designed to be replicable infrastructure, not a single chain.

---

# 2. Blueprint Philosophy

A Tetcore Blueprint defines:

- Module composition
- Economic parameters
- Governance configuration
- Genesis allocation
- Runtime version

Blueprints must produce:

- Deterministic runtime artifact
- Deterministic genesis state
- Deterministic network identity

---

# 3. Module Composition

---

## 3.1 Module Definition

A Module is a deterministic runtime component implementing:

- State storage
- Transition logic
- Host call definitions
- Governance parameters

Examples:

CoreModule  
ConsensusModule  
InferenceModule  
VaultModule  
GovernanceModule  
TreasuryModule  

---

## 3.2 Module Interface

Each module must define:

init(genesis_config)  
execute(transaction)  
export_state()  
migrate(old_state)

Modules must not:

Depend on host OS  
Introduce floating point  
Use nondeterministic iteration  

---

## 3.3 Composition Model

Blueprint defines ordered module stack:

Runtime = Compose(
  CoreModule,
  ConsensusModule,
  GovernanceModule,
  InferenceModule,
  VaultModule,
  TreasuryModule
)

Composition order must be deterministic.

---

## 3.4 Module Isolation

Modules:

- Own separate storage namespaces
- Communicate via explicit interfaces
- Must not modify other module storage directly

---

# 4. Genesis Generation

---

## 4.1 Genesis Configuration Structure

GenesisConfig = {
  chain_id,
  initial_runtime_version,
  initial_validators,
  genesis_balances,
  model_registry,
  governance_parameters,
  economic_parameters
}

---

## 4.2 Deterministic Genesis Hash

Genesis state must produce:

genesis_hash = SHA256(SerializedGenesisState)

All nodes must derive identical genesis_hash.

---

## 4.3 Initial Validators

Genesis must define:

ValidatorSet = {
  validator_address,
  public_key,
  weight
}

Validator ordering must be canonical.

---

## 4.4 Genesis Balances

Must satisfy:

Σ balances = 100B TNT

No additional minting allowed at block 0 beyond declared supply.

---

## 4.5 Genesis Contracts

System contracts may be pre-deployed at reserved addresses.

Bytecode and storage must be deterministic.

---

# 5. Network Bootstrap

---

## 5.1 Chain Identity

Each network defined by:

chain_id: u32

chain_id prevents cross-network replay.

---

## 5.2 Bootstrapping Steps

1. Compile runtime from blueprint
2. Generate genesis state
3. Compute genesis_hash
4. Distribute runtime + genesis to validators
5. Launch block 0

All validators must start from identical genesis.

---

## 5.3 Initial Block

Block 0 must:

- Reference genesis_hash
- Contain no transactions
- Initialize state root

---

# 6. Deterministic Build Requirements

Blueprint compilation must:

- Produce deterministic bytecode
- Use pinned dependency versions
- Avoid nondeterministic build artifacts
- Output runtime_blob_hash

Runtime hash must match governance reference.

---

# 7. Customization Parameters

Blueprint may customize:

- Gas schedule
- Fee model parameters
- Inflation rules
- Governance thresholds
- Module inclusion/exclusion

Customization must not:

Break core invariants
Remove deterministic constraints

---

# 8. Network Types

SDK supports:

1. Mainnet deployment  
2. Sovereign chain  
3. Private enterprise deployment  
4. Testnet / Devnet  
5. Simulation chain  

All share same core architecture.

---

# 9. Upgrade Compatibility

Blueprint must define:

supported_runtime_versions

New runtime versions must:

Include migration plan
Pass deterministic test vectors

---

# 10. Multi-Network Interoperability

Future extension may include:

- Cross-chain messaging
- IFP model bridging
- Shared vault participation

Interoperability must preserve:

Independent chain determinism.

---

# 11. Security Constraints

Blueprint must not:

- Remove capability enforcement
- Disable gas metering
- Allow unbounded memory
- Introduce floating point

SDK must validate blueprint compliance before compilation.

---

# 12. Developer Tooling

SDK must include:

- Runtime builder CLI
- Genesis generator
- Chain configuration validator
- Deterministic hash verifier
- Test harness for state transitions

---

# 13. Blueprint Manifest Format

BlueprintManifest = {
  name,
  version,
  modules,
  parameters,
  genesis_config,
  runtime_hash
}

Manifest must be signed by creator.

---

# 14. Formal Runtime Construction

Let:

Runtime = f(Modules, Parameters)

GenesisState = g(Runtime, GenesisConfig)

Network = (Runtime, GenesisState)

All functions f and g must be deterministic.

---

# 15. Governance of Blueprint Chains

Sovereign deployments may:

- Define independent governance
- Modify economic parameters
- Adjust validator model

Must not:

Claim canonical Tetcore network identity unless authorized.

---

# 16. Economic Isolation

Each chain created via SDK has:

Independent token supply  
Independent governance  
Independent validator set  

No implicit economic coupling.

---

# 17. Reproducibility Requirement

Two independent builds of same blueprint must produce:

Identical runtime_blob_hash  
Identical genesis_hash  

If mismatch:

Build considered invalid.

---

# 18. Licensing Compatibility

Blueprint framework must be compatible with:

Dust Open Source License (Intelligence Infrastructure Edition).

Blueprints may be:

Open-source  
Enterprise-licensed  
Sovereign-controlled  

---

# 19. Long-Term Vision

Tetcore SDK enables:

- Intelligence-specific chains
- Industry-specific deployments
- AI-native sovereign networks
- Custom governance frameworks

Tetcore becomes:

A replicable intelligence infrastructure layer.

---

# 20. Conclusion

SDK-500 defines the Tetcore Blueprint Framework as:

- Modular
- Deterministic
- Composable
- Sovereign-deployable
- Genesis-reproducible

It transforms Tetcore from:

A single protocol  

Into:

A replicable intelligence infrastructure platform.
