# GOV-300  
## Tetcore Governance Constitution  
**Status:** Draft v1.0  
**Category:** Governance Layer  

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework of Tetcore.

It establishes:

- Proposal categories
- Voting mechanisms
- Approval thresholds
- Timelock rules
- Emergency authority boundaries

Governance exists to evolve the protocol without compromising determinism, economic integrity, or consensus safety.

---

# 2. Governance Principles

Tetcore governance must be:

- Deterministic
- Transparent
- On-chain enforceable
- Bounded in scope
- Upgrade-safe

Governance must NOT:

- Retroactively alter finalized state
- Confiscate balances without constitutional authority
- Violate deterministic execution constraints

---

# 3. Governance Participants

Governance voting power is defined by:

- Token holders
- Validators
- Optional dual-chamber structure (if enabled)

Default model: Token-weighted voting.

---

# 4. Proposal Types

Governance proposals fall into defined categories.

---

## 4.1 Parameter Change Proposal

Modifies:

- Gas schedule
- Fee parameters
- TTL rules
- Validator reward distribution
- Economic constants

Cannot modify past blocks.

---

## 4.2 Runtime Upgrade Proposal

Replaces:

- TVM implementation
- Consensus parameters
- State transition logic

Requires higher threshold.

---

## 4.3 Model Governance Proposal

Actions include:

- Disable malicious model
- Freeze revenue routing
- Enforce compliance constraints

Does NOT alter shard commitments.

---

## 4.4 Treasury Proposal

Allocates funds from:

- Governance treasury
- Burn pool (if redirected)

Requires quorum and majority approval.

---

## 4.5 Emergency Proposal

Temporarily activates emergency powers.

Strict time-limited authority.

---

# 5. Proposal Lifecycle

---

## 5.1 Submission

Proposal must include:

- Proposal type
- Target parameters
- Execution payload
- Voting duration
- Timelock duration

Submission requires:

- Minimum proposal bond

---

## 5.2 Voting Period

Voting window defined as:

voting_period_blocks

Votes may be:

- Yes
- No
- Abstain

Votes weighted by:

Token balance snapshot at proposal creation.

---

## 5.3 Approval Threshold

Proposal approved if:

quorum ≥ quorum_requirement
AND
yes_votes ≥ approval_threshold

---

# 6. Voting Thresholds

Default thresholds:

Parameter Change:
- Quorum: 20%
- Approval: >50% of participating votes

Runtime Upgrade:
- Quorum: 40%
- Approval: ≥66%

Treasury:
- Quorum: 25%
- Approval: >50%

Emergency Activation:
- Quorum: 50%
- Approval: ≥75%

Governance may adjust thresholds via Runtime Upgrade.

---

# 7. Timelocks

---

## 7.1 Standard Timelock

After approval:

proposal enters timelock period:

timelock_blocks

Execution allowed only after:

current_height ≥ approval_height + timelock_blocks

---

## 7.2 Purpose

Timelock provides:

- Community review window
- Exit opportunity
- Security monitoring

---

## 7.3 Minimum Timelock

Runtime upgrades must have:

Minimum timelock ≥ 10,000 blocks (example default).

Emergency proposals may override.

---

# 8. Execution

After timelock:

Proposal execution transaction triggers:

Apply changes atomically.

Execution must be deterministic.

If execution fails:

Proposal marked FailedExecution.

---

# 9. Emergency Powers

---

## 9.1 Scope

Emergency powers may:

- Pause inference system
- Disable specific models
- Freeze operator accounts
- Halt shard registry updates

Emergency powers may NOT:

- Seize user balances arbitrarily
- Rewrite historical state
- Bypass deterministic execution rules

---

## 9.2 Duration

Emergency state must:

Expire after emergency_duration_blocks.

Renewal requires new emergency vote.

---

## 9.3 Emergency Committee (Optional)

Governance may designate:

EmergencyCommittee = Set<Address>

Committee may:

Trigger temporary pause (short duration only).

Full emergency requires token vote.

---

# 10. Proposal Bond

To prevent spam:

Proposal submission requires:

bond_amount

If proposal passes:

Bond refunded.

If proposal fails:

Bond partially or fully slashed.

Bond amount defined by governance.

---

# 11. Delegation

Token holders may:

Delegate voting power to another address.

Delegation:

- Does not transfer token ownership
- May be revoked at any time
- Applies to future proposals

---

# 12. Snapshot Rule

Voting power snapshot taken at:

proposal_creation_height

Prevents flash-loan governance manipulation.

---

# 13. Governance Invariants

- No retroactive state mutation
- Deterministic execution
- Transparent voting records
- Fixed execution semantics
- Bounded emergency authority

---

# 14. Upgrade Safety

Runtime upgrades must:

- Preserve state compatibility
- Include migration plan
- Pass deterministic test vectors
- Not alter economic invariants without explicit declaration

---

# 15. Formal Governance Model

Let:

Proposal P = {
  type,
  payload,
  threshold,
  quorum,
  timelock
}

If:

VoteResult(P) satisfies thresholds

Then:

Execute(P.payload) after timelock

Else:

Discard P

---

# 16. Constitutional Limits

Governance cannot:

- Override cryptographic primitives
- Remove deterministic constraints
- Introduce floating point arithmetic
- Circumvent escrow guarantees
- Confiscate funds without predefined slashing rule

---

# 17. Transparency Requirements

All proposals must:

- Be publicly visible
- Include rationale
- Include diff of parameter change
- Include deterministic execution description

---

# 18. Governance Treasury

Treasury funds may be sourced from:

- Gas fees
- Optional protocol fees
- Burn redirection
- Governance allocation

Treasury spending requires proposal approval.

---

# 19. Constitutional Amendments

Changes to:

- Governance thresholds
- Emergency powers scope
- Constitutional limits

Require:

Supermajority ≥ 75%  
Quorum ≥ 50%  
Extended timelock

---

# 20. Conclusion

GOV-300 defines Tetcore governance as:

- Deterministic
- On-chain
- Threshold-based
- Timelocked
- Economically bounded
- Constitutionally constrained

It ensures protocol evolution without sacrificing:

Consensus safety  
Economic integrity  
Deterministic execution  

Governance is powerful, but not absolute.

---

End of GOV-300.
