**Status:** Draft v1.0  
**Category:** Economic Layer

# 1. Purpose

This specification defines the long-term sustainability and monetary policy of the Tetcore network.

It governs:

- Whether inflation exists
- How validators are incentivized
- How the treasury is funded
- How economic security is maintained

This document must be read alongside ECO-400 (Network Token Specification).

---

# 2. Monetary Policy Overview

Default Tetcore monetary policy:

- Fixed genesis supply: 100,000,000,000 tokens
- No mandatory inflation
- Usage-based reward distribution
- Optional governance-enabled inflation

Tetcore is designed to be:

Fee-sustained by inference activity, not inflation-dependent.

---

# 3. Inflation Model

---

## 3.1 Default Rule

By default:

Annual inflation rate = 0%

No automatic minting occurs after genesis.

Total supply remains fixed unless:

Governance explicitly enables controlled inflation.

---

## 3.2 Optional Inflation Activation

Governance may activate inflation via proposal.

Inflation must specify:

- Inflation rate per year (r)
- Mint interval (blocks)
- Distribution target (validators, treasury, etc.)
- Hard cap (optional)

All minting must be deterministic.

---

## 3.3 Inflation Formula (If Enabled)

Let:

S = current_supply  
r = annual_rate (basis points)  
blocks_per_year = B  

Per-block mint:

mint_per_block = floor(
  S × r / 10,000 / B
)

Minted tokens added to:

Designated reward pool.

All arithmetic must use u128 checked math.

---

# 4. Validator Incentives

Tetcore consensus uses Ripple-style BFT.

Validators are incentivized through:

- Gas fee revenue
- Inference revenue share
- Optional inflation rewards
- Governance rewards (if defined)

---

## 4.1 Gas Fee Allocation

Gas fees collected per block may be:

Option A: Fully distributed to validators  
Option B: Partially burned  
Option C: Split between validators and treasury  

Default model:

Majority to validators, small portion to treasury.

---

## 4.2 Inference Revenue Share

Per IFP-105:

validator_bp defines portion of inference fee allocated to validators.

Validator revenue =

Σ inference_settlements × validator_bp / 10,000

This creates direct linkage between:

Network usage and validator revenue.

---

## 4.3 Reward Distribution Model

Validator reward may be:

- Equal split
- Stake-weighted
- Performance-weighted (optional future)

Distribution must be deterministic.

---

# 5. Treasury Funding

Treasury exists to fund:

- Development
- Ecosystem growth
- Security audits
- Emergency stabilization

---

## 5.1 Treasury Funding Sources

Treasury may be funded by:

1. Portion of gas fees  
2. Portion of inference revenue  
3. Optional inflation allocation  
4. Governance-controlled grants  

All funding must be transparent and on-chain.

---

## 5.2 Treasury Address

Treasury is controlled by:

GovernanceContract

Treasury funds may only be spent via:

Approved TreasuryProposal (GOV-300).

---

# 6. Sustainability Model

Tetcore sustainability is based on:

Inference demand.

As inference usage increases:

- Fee revenue increases
- Validator rewards increase
- Vault rewards increase
- Treasury grows organically

No inflation required for long-term viability if usage sufficient.

---

# 7. Deflationary Mechanisms (Optional)

Governance may enable:

- Partial burn of gas fees
- Partial burn of inference fees

Burn reduces total supply:

total_supply_new = total_supply_old - burn_amount

Burn must be deterministic and transparent.

---

# 8. Economic Security Without Inflation

Tetcore relies on:

Usage-based incentives rather than inflationary subsidy.

Security model:

High inference activity → High validator income → Strong consensus security.

If activity low:

Governance may enable temporary inflation.

---

# 9. Inflation Safeguards

If inflation enabled:

Must include:

- Maximum annual cap
- Automatic sunset block
- Governance renewal requirement

Inflation cannot be indefinite without periodic approval.

---

# 10. Economic Invariants

At all times:

- Minting must be explicitly recorded
- Burning must reduce supply deterministically
- No implicit supply change allowed
- All supply changes must pass governance

---

# 11. Validator Cost Assumptions

Validators incur:

- Infrastructure costs
- Network bandwidth
- Storage replication
- Operational overhead

Incentives must:

Cover operational cost + risk margin.

Governance may adjust validator_bp accordingly.

---

# 12. Long-Term Model Scenarios

Scenario A — High Usage, No Inflation  
System fully fee-sustained.

Scenario B — Low Usage, Temporary Inflation  
Governance activates limited inflation.

Scenario C — Growth Phase  
Treasury allocates ecosystem grants.

---

# 13. Formal Monetary State

Let:

S = total_supply  
B = burned  
M = minted  

Invariant:

S = genesis_supply + M - B

All changes to M or B must be governed.

---

# 14. Governance Control Limits

Governance may:

- Enable inflation
- Disable inflation
- Adjust validator share
- Adjust treasury share

Governance may NOT:

- Mint arbitrarily without defined formula
- Bypass timelock for monetary changes
- Rewrite historical balances

---

# 15. Economic Philosophy

Tetcore is designed as:

Intelligence-driven value economy.

Revenue derived from:

Real inference work.

Monetary expansion is:

Optional safety mechanism, not primary incentive.

---

# 16. Transparency Requirements

Network must expose:

- Current supply
- Burned total
- Minted total
- Treasury balance
- Validator reward history

---

# 17. Conclusion

ECO-401 defines Tetcore’s sustainability model as:

- Fixed-supply by default
- Fee-driven incentives
- Optional controlled inflation
- Transparent treasury funding
- Deterministic mint/burn accounting

Tetcore aims to sustain itself through:

Utility, not dilution.
